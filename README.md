# Marvel

Welcome to my MCU gem!  This program scrapes the wikipedia page below and brings back lots of information for each of the current films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  It allows you to sort through the films by their Phase, Tomatoscore, and Box Office Gross.  Each film can also be selected for details on its director, screenwriter, producer, and other information.
